# overview
FunctionsAndErrors is a simple Solidity contract demonstrating the use of error handling functions: require, assert, and revert. These functions help in checking conditions and handling errors in smart contracts.

# Prerequisites
Solidity ^0.8.25

Ethereum development environment (e.g., Truffle, Hardhat)

Ethereum wallet (e.g., MetaMask) for deploying and interacting with the contract

# Usage
1. Deploy the Contract: Use your preferred Ethereum development environment to compile and deploy the contract.
2. Interact with the Functions: You can interact with the contract functions using tools like Remix, Truffle, or directly through your Ethereum wallet.
